## Database Schema Considerations

The database design needs to accommodate:
- Different asset classes (stocks, options, futures, forex, crypto)
- Various broker data formats
- Flexible trade properties
- User customization
- Performance metrics
- Notes and journal entries

A NoSQL database like MongoDB would provide the flexibility needed for this application, allowing for schema evolution as new brokers and features are added.

## API Endpoints Planning

We'll need to design RESTful API endpoints for:
- User management
- Trade data CRUD operations
- Analytics calculations
- Report generation
- Notebook/journal management
- Broker integrations
- Data import/export

## Security Considerations

- Secure storage of broker API credentials
- Data encryption for sensitive information
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Regular security audits

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient data processing for large trade histories
- Pagination for large datasets
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Optimized database queries
- Lazy loading of components and data

## Next Steps

1. Design detailed database schema
2. Create wireframes for key interfaces
3. Set up development environment
4. Implement core user authentication
5. Develop trade data models
